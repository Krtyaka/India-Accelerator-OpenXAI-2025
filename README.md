# 🚀 Hackathon Contributions

This repository will contain my contributions for an upcoming hackathon.  
The project idea is still evolving, but here’s the initial plan:

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Frontend:** Next.js + TypeScript  
- **Backend:** LLM-based models (with APIs)  
- **Other Tools:** To be decided later

---

## 📌 Note
As development progresses, this README will be updated with project details, features, and contribution links.

✨ This repo is a placeholder for my hackathon work and will be actively updated once the project begins.
